<blockquote>
<p>The first in a series (hopefully) of short journal entries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started a new job in South Bay and finally escaped from Ottawa</p>
<p>Things that have happened to me/things I&rsquo;ve noticed in my first month here</p>
<ul>
<li>witnessed at least 4 people with the exact same shirt and one guy with the same shirt AND pants combo in the span of 30 minutes
<ul>
<li>I need new clothes
<ul>
<li>I need to stop shopping at Uniqlo
<ul>
<li>at least I need to stop buying ALL my clothes from Uniqlo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>got taken to eat pho in the hood
<ul>
<li>I watched an insane amount of people getting arrested from the window of my Uber
<ul>
<li>and then my Uber stopped and let me out right in front of the altercation</li>
<li>I also saw someone huffing Galaxy Gas for the first time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>almost got mauled by a dog on an SF bus at 10 pm at night after an One Okay Rock concert
<ul>
<li>we got on the bus and sat down without realizing there was a scruffy looking dude with his giant dog sat across from us</li>
<li>one of my friends was smart and noticed the dog so he stood at a safe distance and took photos</li>
<li>his girlfriend did not give a fuck and sat down next to the dog</li>
<li>myself and my other friend were incredibly locked in the entire bus ride trying not to draw aggro from the dog as it kept barking
<ul>
<li>the owner tried his best to calm the dog down and at one point put his fist in the dog&rsquo;s mouth to try to calm it down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>after the ride was over the friend sitting next to me told me he was staring the dog in the eyes the ENTIRE RIDE
<ul>
<li>this makes a lot more sense as to why the dog was so pissed off for the entire duration of the ride</li>
<li>this friend needs to be studied</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that same night i had the most amazing donuts at a 24 hr donut shop
<ul>
<li>24 hr donuts is a new concept to me
<ul>
<li>the name of the place was Bob&rsquo;s Donut</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waymo is kind of insane in SF and i would recommend it over taking Ubers
<ul>
<li>if only Waymo didn&rsquo;t cost 2x the price of Uber</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the drivers here are really crazy
<ul>
<li>within 48 hours of landing we almost got hit by a driver taking a left turn on a red</li>
<li>i have witnessed at least half a dozen instances of drivers cutting the triangle because they were stuck on the lane leading to the off ramp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the same vein of thought, I noticed a stunning mentality difference when it comes to car purchases
<ul>
<li>people in America (this is a sweeping generalization) often don&rsquo;t care about fuel economy or utility as the first priority when buying a car</li>
<li>they care more about whether the car will help them survive in an accident</li>
<li>this is because they have come the to conclusion that they WILL get into an accident at some point and they want to keep living</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve seen single people who don&rsquo;t haul stuff drive massive SUVs solely because everyone else has a massive car too and they don&rsquo;t want to be stuck holding the short end of the stick when a car runs a red and t-bones them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am going to need to go to gym if I keep eating so much free food</li>
<li>my sleep schedule fixed itself
<ul>
<li>I used to sleep at 3 am and wake up at like 11 am while I was on EST</li>
<li>now I sleep at 12 and wake up at 8 which is perfect</li>
<li>its been over a month and my body still hasn&rsquo;t revered back to the shitty sleep so maybe I&rsquo;m fixed
<ul>
<li>either that or the blackout curtains I had in my room at home were destroying my circadian rhythm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the weather here is incredibly foreign
<ul>
<li>what do you mean that for the next 8 months there will be no rain at all and every day will be the exact same weather</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
