      <description>June 2nd, 2025  The first in a series (hopefully) of short journal entries
 I started a new job in South Bay and finally escaped from Ottawa
Things that have happened to me/things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in my first month here
 witnessed at least 4 people with the exact same shirt and one guy with the same shirt AND pants combo in the span of 30 minutes  I need new clothes  I need to stop shopping at Uniqlo  at least I need to stop buying ALL my clothes from Uniqlo       got taken to eat pho in the hood  I watched an insane amount of people getting arrested from the window of my Uber  and then my Uber stopped and let me out right in front of the altercation I also saw someone huffing Galaxy Gas for the first time     almost got mauled by a dog on an SF bus at 10 pm at night after an One Okay Rock concert  we got on the bus and sat down without realizing there was a scruffy looking dude with his giant dog sat across from us one of my friends was smart and noticed the dog so he stood at a safe distance and took photos his girlfriend did not give a fuck and sat down next to the dog myself and my other friend were incredibly locked in the entire bus ride trying not to draw aggro from the dog as it kept barking  the owner tried his best to calm the dog down and at one point put his fist in the dog&amp;rsquo;s mouth to try to calm it down   after the ride was over the friend sitting next to me told me he was staring the dog in the eyes the ENTIRE RIDE  this makes a lot more sense as to why the dog was so pissed off for the entire duration of the ride this friend needs to be studied     that same night i had the most amazing donuts at a 24 hr donut shop  24 hr donuts is a new concept to me  the name of the place was Bob&amp;rsquo;s Donut     Waymo is kind of insane in SF and i would recommend it over taking Ubers  if only Waymo didn&amp;rsquo;t cost 2x the price of Uber   the drivers here are really crazy  within 48 hours of landing we almost got hit by a driver taking a left turn on a red i have witnessed at least half a dozen instances of drivers cutting the triangle because they were stuck on the lane leading to the off ramp   in the same vein of thought, I noticed a stunning mentality difference when it comes to car purchases  people in America (this is a sweeping generalization) often don&amp;rsquo;t care about fuel economy or utility as the first priority when buying a car they care more about whether the car will help them survive in an accident this is because they have come the to conclusion that they WILL get into an accident at some point and they want to keep living I&amp;rsquo;ve seen single people who don&amp;rsquo;t haul stuff drive massive SUVs solely because everyone else has a massive car too and they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be stuck holding the short end of the stick when a car runs a red and t-bones them   I am going to need to go to gym if I keep eating so much free food my sleep schedule fixed itself  I used to sleep at 3 am and wake up at like 11 am while I was on EST now I sleep at 12 and wake up at 8 which is perfect its been over a month and my body still hasn&amp;rsquo;t revered back to the shitty sleep so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m fixed  either that or the blackout curtains I had in my room at home were destroying my circadian rhythm     the weather here is incredibly foreign  what do you mean that for the next 8 months there will be no rain at all and every day will be the exact same weather    </description>

      <description>Daniel H. Wilson
 A story I loved so much I had to transcribe it from William Flew&amp;rsquo;s Archive
 Science fiction is so intriguing because it can examine the cosmic and the infinitesimal, the future and the past, the human and the immesurable.
Daniel H. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s story does all that, in less than four thousand words.
 &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s late at night, my darling. And the stars are in the sky.</description>
