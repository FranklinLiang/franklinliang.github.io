      <description>Hiatus It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last blog entry, but I had a draft of this post kicking around from October of 2021 talking about the stuff I did with the homelab (past tense I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that). I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about the super technical details or challenges I faced since I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember what happened, but I will try my best.
Great things I had great aspirations for the homelab when I first got it running.</description>

      <description>Why, How and What I felt incredible joy after finishing my final exam of the term following 12 months of continuous schooling. But less than 72 hours later I was already bored. I needed something to do, so I made the Friedman translator. This was a project that would normally take me weeks due to dealing with school, but I finished it in under two days. I needed a bigger project.</description>

      <description>Who is Elliotte Friedman? This is Elliotte Friedman.
 This tweet has since been deleted, here is a saved screenshot
 CAL and MON are not abbreviations. With this translator now you can make an educated guess as to what ELF is trying to say.
 What did Elliot Friedman say this time: Decipher  function friedman() { var acronym = document.getElementById(&#34;myText&#34;); var teams = [&#34;Anaheim Ducks&#34;, &#34;Arizona Coyotes&#34;, &#34;Boston Bruins&#34;</description>

      <description>Introduction The first time I had ever used AHK was back in highschool. My friend made a Discord bot called &amp;ldquo;Starmine&amp;rdquo; that would give out points whenever a user typed !starmine.
It was a fun incremental/idle game that we all played, and while you could wait for the passive point generation, the fastest way to get points was to type !starmine.
The game got really competitive and as we went into the summer months and I needed a way to edge out the competition.</description>

      <description>This post is based on Robert DeVore&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Run a Tor relay&amp;rdquo; found here: https://www.robertdevore.com/run-a-tor-relay/
 Tor is a service used by thousands of people everyday to access the internet safely and anonymously.
While I have been using Tor for quite some time, it always seemed daunting to help the Tor network by running a relay. Horror stories about getting mail from ISPs relating to the traffic of anonymous users accessing illegal materials masked by your IP.</description>
